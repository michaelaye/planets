# Installation

## Stable release

To install planets, run this command in your terminal:

```console
$ pip install planets
```

This is the preferred method to install planets, as it will always install the most recent stable release. 

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide you through the process.

## From sources
